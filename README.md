# Access_Patterns_cach_storage

Summary:

    Write-Through: Ensures strong consistency by writing to both the cache and storage.

    Write-Back: Improves performance for write-heavy access patterns by asynchronously syncing to storage.

    Write-Around: Bypasses the cache for infrequent updates, focusing on direct writes to the persistent store.

    Read with Fallback: Combines cache and storage for efficient data access.
